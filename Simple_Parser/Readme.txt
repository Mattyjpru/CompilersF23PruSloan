Our Parser is created using a yacc file. The Makefile that is included will do 
everything for you, so using the make command will tokenize and parse our example 
programs and output the parse tree into PS_Parser_Out.txt.
We used an Ubuntu command line to run and compile the files, so the version of lex and yacc (bison)
that we used is the one that comes from the command: sudo apt-get install flex bison
