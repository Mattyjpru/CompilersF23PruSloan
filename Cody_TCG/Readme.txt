Our symbol table is written in our parser file. The Makefile that is included will do 
everything for you, so using the make command will tokenize and parse our example 
program and output the symbol table into PS_ST_Parser_Out.txt and stdout.
We used an Ubuntu command line to run and compile the files, so the version of lex and yacc (bison)
that we used is the one that comes from the command: sudo apt-get install flex bison
